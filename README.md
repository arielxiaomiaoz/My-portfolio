# My Portfolio
## Author: Ariel Zhang
## Introduction:
This is my first portfolio website. It is a single page website with a navigation anchored to different location. This website includes 'About me', 'My portfolio' and 'Contact me'. With this website, you can send me email, get to my github, codepen, linkedin and instagram account.
